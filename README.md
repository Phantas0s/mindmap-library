Reading is not enough for me: to learn, I need to make the knowledge my own. The goal?

* To remember it.
* To use it in many different contexts ("transfer").

I love making *detailed mindmaps* of everything I find interesting. Here's how it looks like:

Using mindmaps allows me to:

* Easily review any piece of knowledge I want.
* Test myself to see if I remember the knowledge by hiding the branches.
* Focus on some part of the knowledge I capture by hiding the branches.
* Have a very visual version of the knowledge instead of trying to find the good place in a book or video.

I use the open source software [Freemind](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freemind/) to create these mindmaps. Why?

* It's simple.
* It's fast.
* It's stable.
* The interface is keyboard-friendly.
* The maps created are in plain text (XML). If you use Vim and the shell, you can search and filter everything you want.

I've mindmaps with hundred of nodes and Freemind never let me down.

You can have access to all my mindmaps too if you sponsor me on Github. See [here for more information](https://github.com/sponsors/Phantas0s).

Here's the list of mindmaps (files with the extension ".mm"):
